There is already a vast amount of Creative Commons audio out there in the word and in the [AudioCommons](http://www.audiocommons.org/) project we explore its use for creative industries. 

I am co-mentoring one of the [innovation challenges](http://sic.upf.edu/) for this year's edition of the [SÃ³nar+D](https://sonarplusd.com/) festival.  The idea for this challenge is to create a music instrument (hardware or software) that can help artists to discover, interact and play with Creative Commons audio content (samples or even entire music tracks) using our audio analysis technologies.

We are searching for music technologists, creative developers, and UI/UX designers. More details [here](http://sic.upf.edu/challenges/audiocommons/).
