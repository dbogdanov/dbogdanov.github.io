![Top 20 tags per category (genre, instrument, mood/theme) in the MTG-Jamendo dataset]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/mediaeval2019_tagcloud.png)

We are pleased to announce a new MIR-related task held within the
MediaEval 2019 evaluation campaign: [Emotion and Theme Recognition in
Music Using Jamendo](https://multimediaeval.github.io/2019-Emotion-and-Theme-Recognition-in-Music-Task/).

The Benchmarking Initiative for Multimedia Evaluation (MediaEval)
organizes an annual cycle of scientific evaluation tasks in the area of
multimedia access and retrieval. In our task, we invite the participants
to try their skills at predicting mood and theme tags associated with
music recordings using audio analysis and machine learning algorithms.

The task is framed as an auto-tagging problem with tags specific to
moods and themes (e.g., happy, dark, epic, melodic, love, film, space).
To build the dataset for this task we used a collection of music from
Jamendo that is available under the Creative Commons licenses with tag
annotations that come from authors/musicians.

All interested researchers are warmly welcomed to participate. See the [MediaEval
Multimedia Benchmark Workshop](http://www.multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2019/) for the results of the challenge.
